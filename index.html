        <b>Or: The <i>real</i> getting filthy rich off crypto is the things you
        learn along the way!</b>
      <p>
        I have a bunch of time on my hands after finishing an assistantship, so
        I figure I should put some of it into a project.
        It's been a while since I've worked on this one,
        so I'm writing this to re-familiarize myself with what I
        was doing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Trying to 'solve' fincancial markets is very appealing,
        as they feature high levels of complexity as well as obvious incentives.
        Cryptocurrencies at this point offer the most approachable markets,
        so they are a clear fit for an exploratory project.
        The approach of this project is to predict the direction of a market
        using relatively simple line regressions.
      </p>

      </figure>

      <p>
        The underlying assumption of what I've now called <i>momentum regression</i> (why
        it's called that will become clear later) is that markets generally move with
        a sinusoid pattern through time, as shown in figure 1.
        This assumption kind of holds, but sadly, as you will read below,
        reality is a lot more messy.
      </p>

      <img src="images/expfit.png" alt="expfit" width=100%>

      I show are all eyeballed.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        Still, if the general pattern holds, we can try to identify troughs, peaks,
        and everything in between.
        Notice that the start of an upwards movement in a sine wave can be
        approximated by an exponential function (figure 2).
        The fitting of exponential functions is reasonably straightforward:
        performing linear regression on the straight line that results from taking the
        natural logarithm of an exponential set of data:<br>
        <i>ln(e<sup>x</sup>) = x</i>.
        I call this part of the curve the <i>exponential phase</i>.
      </p>
      <figure>
      <img src="images/linfit.png" alt="linfit" width=100%>
      <figcaption>Figure 3: Fit of linear phase.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        Similarly, we can fit other parts of the sinus curve, including the linear
        growth, logarithmic growth and exponential decrease (short selling!) parts.
        For now I'll only talk about the <i>linear phase</i>,
        which is illustrated in figure 3.
        This part we can fit with regular old linear regression.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, if we continually try to fit exponential functions to price data,
        we can identify buy signals based on the values <i>&alpha;</i>
        and <i>&beta;</i> in <i>&alpha;e<sup>&beta;x</sup></i> as well as the
        quality of fit.
        Effectively, these three properties are a measure of
        upwards <i>momentum</i>, arrived at through line <i>regression</i> (I still
        think I can do better with the name).
      </p>
      <p>
        Sell signals, then, are when momentum is lost.
        There's multiple ways of handling this, but let's just consider the
        linear phase the time we want to sell.
        With these things in mind, I set out to find
        some <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/tencars/392-crypto-currency-pairs-at-minute-resolution">
        price data</a> to mess around with.
      </p>
      <p>
        Starting out in python, I did not understand the buy/sell signals I was
        getting out of backtests.
        Wanting to dig a little deeper but not knowing my way around the
        libraries I was using, I decided to build my own linear regression
        program in C++.
        On top of being able to better interpret what was going on,
        this had the nice effect of speeding up my backtesting considerably
        (moreover, I had been wanting to work on an optimization problem
        for a while).
      </p>
      <p>
        Everything eventually led to a fevered week of me being convinced I
        would make absurd amounts of money.
        That is, until I checked what kind of commissions I would be paying, as
        well as the losses I'd take on buy/sell spread.
        As it turns out, getting rich off internet money is more difficult than
        I thought.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'll be going over a number of problems I encountered. Some of those
        problems I don't believe can be solved, but there should be ways to make
        this method profitable.
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img style="float:left" src="images/trade_6.png" alt="trade6" width=50%>
        <img style="float:right" src="images/trade_2.png" alt="trade2" width=50%>
        <figcaption>Figure 4: Two examples of actual trades. Bought at time 900
          (vertical line) and sold at last datapoint.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        The first problem I encountered was that oftentimes,
        fitted exponential functions are very flat,
        and even if they are more sharp,
        a lot of times it is possible to fit linear functions with a comparable level of
        confidence.
        The left image in figure 4 spotlights this.
        I haven't been able to properly add the fitted functions into price
        data plots, but it's easy to see that you can draw both exponential and
        linear functions.
        The workaround here is that I force the program to hold off selling by
        scaling the linear fit's required confidence level with elapsed time.
        However, this leads to cases such as the right image, where selling
        quickly would be preferable.
        Generally in the real world, the exponential phase appears to be slower
        than the other parts of the sinus curve.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another problem is that there are a lot of parameters to consider,
        and the more time I put into this project the more tweakable quantities
        I find.
        Finding an optimal configuration explodes in complexity.
        Then, even if you find an optimum,
        it is potentially highly biased by the dataset you've used for
        backtesting.
        This problem doesn't simply go away.
        It may help to find a way to characterize your datasets,
        and specify different parameter sets for different types of market.
        If it is possible to generate meaningful characterizations,
        I'd guess an unsupervised machine learning algorithm would be
        pretty good at this kind of thing.
      </p>
      <p>
        This entry is turning out longer than I had anticipated, so I'm going to
        stop here.
        I don't know if I'll end up beating the market with this approach: it
        will probably involve stacking a bunch more complexity on top of my
        current methods, at which point the effort may just become too large.
        At least I will have learned a lot in the process.
        Even a simple optimization problem such as linear regression
        featured bumps in the road, for instance, and I look forward looking
        into machine learning now that I have a suitable reason to.

      <p>
        Building this site was a lot easier than the last time I tried.
        Stealing the html and css from other people helped immensely.
        The overal layout is the same as that of
        <a href="https://www.chriswere.uk">Chris Were's website</a>,
        and this blog entry class is copied from
        <a href="https://www.lukesmith.xyz">Luke Smith</a>.
        Having the site properly built before taking it live gives me some
        confidence in paying for a long-running VPS contract as well as
        incentive towards actually figuring out https and DNS resolution.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now before I put this up I need to decide on a domain name and set up an
        email server.
        I own kaveeken.nl, but maybe a more explicit one works better, i.e.
        krisveeken.nl.
        I would like a a hip shortened domain like veek.en,
        but there is no .en TLD. Closest would be vee.kn,
        which is almost a hundred times more expensive than other TLDs.
        Lastly, I need to write myself an introduction and maybe finish a post
        on a project before there's enough content on here to be worth
        sharing.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'd like to keep this website down to a single page,
        but blog entries may require and index as well as unique pages.
