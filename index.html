      My name is Kris Veeken and this is my website.
      I am a master's student of biology,
      broadly interested in mathematical modeling,
      theoretical biology and interdisciplinary research.
    </p>
    <p>
      The purpose of this website is to offer a public way of finding and
      getting in contact with me,
      as well a place to describe what I've been working on.

        <b>Or: The <i>real</i> getting filthy rich off crypto is the things you
        learn along the way!</b>
      <p>
        I have a bunch of time on my hands after finishing an assistantship, so
        I figure I should put some of it into a project.
        It's been a while since I've worked on this one,
        so I'm writing this to re-familiarize myself with what I
        was doing.

      <p>
        The underlying assumption of what I've now called <i>momentum regression</i> (why
        it's called that will become clear later) is that markets generally move with
        a sinusoid pattern through time, as shown in figure 1.
        This assumption kind of holds, but sadly, as you will read below,
        reality is a lot more messy.

      <img src="images/expfit.png" alt="expfit" width=100%>
      <figcaption>Figure 2: exponential fit of part of the sine wave. The fits
      I show are all eyeballed.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        Still, if the general pattern holds, we can try to identify troughs, peaks,
        and everything in between.
        Notice that the start of an upwards movement in a sine wave can be
        approximated by an exponential function (figure 2).
        The fitting of exponential functions is reasonably straightforward:
        performing linear regression on the straight line that results from taking the
        natural logarithm of an exponential set of data:<br>
        <i>ln(e<sup>x</sup>) = x</i>.
        I call this part of the curve the <i>exponential phase</i>.
      </p>

      <img src="images/linfit.png" alt="linfit" width=100%>
      <figcaption>Figure 3: fit of linear phase.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        Similarly, we can fit other parts of the sinus curve, including the linear
        growth, logarithmic growth and exponential decrease (short selling!) parts.
        For now I'll only talk about the <i>linear phase</i>,
        which is illustrated in figure 3.
        This part we can fit with regular old linear regression.

        Building this site was a lot easier than the last time I tried.
        Stealing the html and css from other people helped immensely.
        The overal layout is the same as that of
        <a href="https://www.chriswere.uk">Chris Were's website</a>,
        and this blog entry class is copied from
        <a href="https://www.lukesmith.xyz">Luke Smith</a>.
        Having the site properly built before taking it live gives me some
        confidence in paying for a long-running VPS contract as well as
        incentive towards actually figuring out https and DNS resolution.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now before I put this up I need to decide on a domain name and set up an
        email server.
        I own kaveeken.nl, but maybe a more explicit one works better, i.e.
        krisveeken.nl.
        I would like a a hip shortened domain like veek.en,
        but there is no .en TLD. Closest would be vee.kn,
        which is almost a hundred times more expensive than other TLDs.
        Lastly, I need to write myself an introduction and maybe finish a post
        on a project before there's enough content on here to be worth
        sharing.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'd like to keep this website down to a single page,
        but blog entries may require and index as well as unique pages.
