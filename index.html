    <p>
      My name is Kris Veeken and this is my website.
      I am a master's student of biology,
      broadly interested in mathematical modeling,
      theoretical biology and interdisciplinary research.
    </p>
    <p>
      The purpose of this website is to offer a public way of finding and
      getting in contact with me,
      as well a place to describe what I've been working on.
    </p>

      <p>
        Building this site was a lot easier than the last time I tried.
        Stealing the html and css from other people helped immensely.
        The overal layout is the same as that of
        <a href="https://www.chriswere.uk">Chris Were's website</a>,
        and this blog entry class is copied from
        <a href="https://www.lukesmith.xyz">Luke Smith</a>.
        Having the site properly built before taking it live gives me some
        confidence in paying for a long-running VPS contract as well as
        incentive towards actually figuring out https and DNS resolution.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now before I put this up I need to decide on a domain name and set up an
        email server.
        I own kaveeken.nl, but maybe a more explicit one works better, i.e.
        krisveeken.nl.
        I would like a a hip shortened domain like veek.en,
        but there is no .en TLD. Closest would be vee.kn,
        which is almost a hundred times more expensive than other TLDs.
        Lastly, I need to write myself an introduction and maybe finish a post
        on a project before there's enough content on here to be worth
        sharing.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'd like to keep this website down to a single page,
        but blog entries may require and index as well as unique pages.
